# Time calculation {#sec-calctime}

Here we showed the calculation time of each process in *methylR* for both full and lite versions.

| module    | processes | calculation time (mm:ss) |
|-----------|-----------|--|
| methylysis | local run - ChAMP   |  |
|              | (params: BMIQ, batch correction, cores = 4) | 03:11 s|
|   |  server run - ChAMP |   |
|   |  (params: BMIQ, batch correction, cores = 2) | 03:10 s*  |
|   |  local run - minfi |   |
|   |  (params: raw, filters, cores = 4) | 04:01 s  |
|   |  server run - minfi |   |
|   | (params: raw, filters, cores = 2)  |  03:40 s |
| multi-D  |   | 00:2 s  |
| gene features |   |  00:02 s |
| heatmap   |   |  00:01 s |
| volcano  |   |  00:18 s |
| chromosome  |   | 00:04 s  |
| gene ontology  |   | 01:30 s  |
