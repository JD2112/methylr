    "text": "Important\n\n\n\nTO ALL OUR USERS, IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCING ANY TROUBLE WITH THE APP, BEFORE SENDING THE BUG REPORT, PLEASE RESTART THE DOCKER CONTAINER AND TRY AGAIN.\nDNA Methylation is one of the most studied epigenetic modifications in humans, playing a critical role in cellular response, development and differentiation (Das et al. 2019). The transfer of a methyl group onto the C5 position of the cytosine to form 5-methyl-cytosine is considered as the DNA methylation or epigenetic mechanism in human or mammalian genome (Moore, Le, and Fan 2013). Epigenetic research has its roots in plant science, which emerged in the early 20th century. In human medicine, cancer biology has driven the field forwards during the last two decades and in combination with modern, array-based techniques and nex-generation sequencing now provides the scientific community with an easily accessible tool to study epigenetics at a whole-genome level (Das et al. 2021). To find the methylated site or the CpG site, Illumina(R) uses DNA methylation array-based technology. Till date three different array platforms are available from Illumina for human genome to identify the CpG site or specific DNA methylation location, namely 27K, 450K or 850K. A more detail history and timeline can be found here in this article by Harrison and Pari-McDermott (2011) (Harrison and Parle-McDermott 2011). After performing the array, the major part is the analysis of the raw data generated from the machine. Numerous tools are available to analyze the data using different operating system, various computational languages. And all of these tools require extensive handling of computational resources. For the Biologist or those who have limited computational knowledge, it is extremely difficult to handle all these tools.\nHere, in methylR, we presented a shiny-based web server approach to minimize the above-mentioned difficulties. MethylR has graphical user interface to support and understand the various options used in the DNA methylation analysis with an extensive manual/tutorial how to use it. The background computational power depends on the user’s computer which can also be optimized. We successfully tested the pipeline on Linux based system.\nCopyright © 2022-2023.

    "text": "Methylysis is the most important section in methylR since it contains the tools to analyze the DNA methylation data for two different Illumina arrays, 450K and 850K array. Two of the most used well-defined pipelines are currently available in methylR: The Chip Analysis Methylation Pipeline ChAMP and minfi. Those are alternative pipelines and, although the user has the freedom to decide to test both, only the results from one of them is required to run to visualize and explore the data in the downstream sections. For new users, we suggest to run ChAMP as it is the latest, well packed and well maintained pipeline for Illumina HumanMethylation Array data analysis. Both pipelines offer different input options and parameters that can be modified based on the user’s actual data. If users wish to compare the results from both the pipelines, methylR offers this possibility through the downstream processing (Venn Analysis see Chapter 9 and UpSet Plot see Chapter 10 sections).\nCopyright © 2022-2023.

    "text": "1.2 Parameters setup\n\n1.2.1 Choose analysis algorithm\nCurrently, we have included two most usable algorithms to analyze the data - ChAMP and minfi.\n\n\n\n\nAlgorithm choice\n\n\n\n1.2.1.1 ChAMP pipeline parameters\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE: ChAMP will do all filtration automatically, independent of User’s input. The following filtration will be done -\ni. filtering probes with detection p-value > 0.01,\nii. filter out probes with <3 beads in at least 5% of samples per probe,\niii. filter all non-CpG probes\niv. filter all SNP-related probes\nv. filter all multi-hit probes\nvi. filter all probes located in X and Y chromosomes\n\n\n\nChoose type of Illumina array: Two options are provided to choose, namely EPIC/850K array and 450K array from Illumina array analysis.\nAdjusted P-value: User can define there own adjusted P-value to run the analysis. The default is 0.05.\nNormalization: User can choose different normalization methods from the drop-down list,\n\nBMIQ (Beta-Mixture Quantile Normalization) (Teschendorff et al. 2013),\nPBC (Peak-Based Correction) (Dedeurwaerder et al. 2011),\n\n\nThe default setup will run with the BMIQ normalization method. Please check references for different type of normalization method\n\nBatch Effect Correction: ComBat function is used to correct the batch effect. User can choose whether to compute the batch effect or not by clicking the button. When the button is “green” (ON), it will prompt to select the factors for the batch effect correction, Slide, Array, Age, Sex, or Other. Select as necessary and should have the column in the Sample_sheet. If you have other option than Slide, Array, Age or Sex, rename the column as ‘Other’ and run batch effect correction. If the button is “red” (OFF), the pipeline will continue without analyzing the batch effect. Please check the reference for the batch effect correction using combat method (Johnson, Li, and Rabinovic 2007).\nCell Type Heterogeneity: Houseman et al (2013) (Houseman et al. 2012) algorithm is applied to calculate the cell-type heterogeneity from PBMC dataset using the refbase function. This is deactivated as default. Press the button to activate and run during the analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nChAMP parameters setup\n\n\n\n\n1.2.1.2 Minfi pipeline parameters\n\nChoose preprocess method : There are several methods available for preprocessing or normalizing the raw data using the RGset. Here we listed them as the user’s input options to select the preprocess/normalization method as per their choice:\n\nRaw: No processing of the raw data,\nSWAN: Subset Quantile Within array Normalization (Maksimovic, Gordon, and Oshlack 2012; Touleimat and Tost 2012),\nNoob: Noob preprocessing (Triche Jr et al. 2013),\nIllumina: Illumina preprocessing, as performed by Genome Studio (reverse engineered by minfi authors) (Aryee et al. 2014)\nFunnorm: Functional normalization (Fortin et al. 2014)\n\nSelect filtration method: In this section, we assigned options for the user to perform the different filters, like removal of XY chromosomes from the analysis, removal of SNPs or removal of non-specific probes from the dataset. By default, the pipeline will use p-value detection 0.01.\nCompute cell type heterogeneity: similar as ChAMP, we used Houseman method to correct the cell type heterogeneity. In minfi pipeline we used default minfi function estimateCellCounts. As before, user can choose to avoid this if the samples are not from PBMC cell types.\nPlease select the compare groups: In this option, the pipeline will ask the user to type the group names which will be compared for the differential methylation analysis. To compute the ContrastsMatrix, these group names will be used. Please use the same groups as provide in the Sample_sheet.csv.\nChoose genome annotation database: To annotate the DMC list from the analysis, use the human genome reference annotation data file. For 850K array, make sure to use the hg38 array to compare the result with the output of ChAMP pipeline.\n\n\n\n\n\nMinfi parameters setup"

If you have data with more than 50 samples, using 4 cores may reduce the calculation time. If the dataset has less number of samples, increasing the number of cores will not do effectively any better time reduction.\n\n\n\nData upload The user should set the parameters first and choose all parameters as described above and then upload the data directory. To do that, just click on the button “Browse…” and locate the zip archive containing raw files. As soon as the pipeline finishes the upload of the data directory, it will start running the analysis."

Either ChAMP and minfi will provide the input data or you can get test data by clicking on “Matrix example data” and “List example data” buttons. For a better view of the result, we added the functionality to change the number of variables on the heatmap.\n\n\n4.1.2 Settings\n\nPlot type - User can choose the heatmap or correlation plot function for the analysis.\nCorrelation Coefficient - four different types of correlation coefficient added in the module, 1) Pearson, 2) Spearman, 3) Kendall and 4) no-correlation (better for heatmap).
