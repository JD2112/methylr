	abstract = {MOTIVATION: The recently released Infinium HumanMethylation450 array (the '450k' array) provides a high-throughput assay to quantify DNA methylation (DNAm) at ∼450 000 loci across a range of genomic features. Although less comprehensive than high-throughput sequencing-based techniques, this product is more cost-effective and promises to be the most widely used DNAm high-throughput measurement technology over the next several years.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Here we describe a suite of computational tools that incorporate state-of-the-art statistical techniques for the analysis of DNAm data. The software is structured to easily adapt to future versions of the technology. We include methods for preprocessing, quality assessment and detection of differentially methylated regions from the kilobase to the megabase scale. We show how our software provides a powerful and flexible development platform for future methods. We also illustrate how our methods empower the technology to make discoveries previously thought to be possible only with sequencing-based methods.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/minfi.html.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONTACT: khansen@jhsph.edu; rafa@jimmy.harvard.edu$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {Illumina Infinium DNA Methylation BeadChips represent the most widely used genome-scale DNA methylation assays. Existing strategies for masking Infinium probes overlapping repeats or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are based largely on ad hoc assumptions and subjective criteria. In addition, the recently introduced MethylationEPIC (EPIC) array expands on the utility of this platform, but has not yet been well characterized. We present in this paper an extensive characterization of probes on the EPIC and HM450 microarrays, including mappability to the latest genome build, genomic copy number of the 3΄ nested subsequence and influence of polymorphisms including a previously unrecognized color channel switch for Type I probes. We show empirical evidence for exclusion criteria for underperforming probes, providing a sounder basis than current ad hoc criteria for exclusion. In addition, we describe novel probe uses, exemplified by the addition of a total of 1052 SNP probes to the existing 59 explicit SNP probes on the EPIC array and the use of these probes to predict ethnicity. Finally, we present an innovative out-of-band color channel application for the dual use of 62 371 probes as internal bisulfite conversion controls.},

	abstract = {Background: Although aberrant DNA methylation has been observed previously in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the patterns of differential methylation have not been comprehensively determined in all subtypes of ALL on a genome-wide scale. The relationship between DNA methylation, cytogenetic background, drug resistance and relapse in ALL is poorly understood.Results: We surveyed the DNA methylation levels of 435,941 CpG sites in samples from 764 children at diagnosis of ALL and from 27 children at relapse. This survey uncovered four characteristic methylation signatures. First, compared with control blood cells, the methylomes of ALL cells shared 9,406 predominantly hypermethylated CpG sites, independent of cytogenetic background. Second, each cytogenetic subtype of ALL displayed a unique set of hyper- and hypomethylated CpG sites. The CpG sites that constituted these two signatures differed in their functional genomic enrichment to regions with marks of active or repressed chromatin. Third, we identified subtype-specific differential methylation in promoter and enhancer regions that were strongly correlated with gene expression. Fourth, a set of 6,612 CpG sites was predominantly hypermethylated in ALL cells at relapse, compared with matched samples at diagnosis. Analysis of relapse-free survival identified CpG sites with subtype-specific differential methylation that divided the patients into different risk groups, depending on their methylation status.Conclusions: Our results suggest an important biological role for DNA methylation in the differences between ALL subtypes and in their clinical outcome after treatment. 2013 Nordlund et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {The protection against tuberculosis induced by the Bacille Calmette Gu{\'{e}}rin (BCG) vaccine is unpredictable. In our previous study, altered DNA methylation pattern in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in response to BCG was observed in a subgroup of individuals, whose macrophages killed mycobacteria effectively (‘responders'). These macrophages also showed production of Interleukin-1$\beta$ (IL-1$\beta$) in response to mycobacterial stimuli before vaccination. Here, we hypothesized that the propensity to respond to the BCG vaccine is reflected in the DNA methylome. We mapped the differentially methylated genes (DMGs) in PBMCs isolated from responders/non-responders at the time point before vaccination aiming to identify possible predictors of BCG responsiveness. We identified 43 DMGs and subsequent bioinformatic analyses showed that these were enriched for actin-modulating pathways, predicting differences in phagocytosis. This could be validated by experiments showing that phagocytosis of mycobacteria, which is an event preceding mycobacteria-induced IL-1$\beta$ production, was strongly correlated with the DMG pattern.},

Here we present an R package called GOplot, based on ggplot2, for enhanced graphical representation. Our package takes the output of any general enrichment analysis and generates plots at different levels of detail: from a general overview to identify the most enriched categories (bar plot, bubble plot) to a more detailed view displaying different types of information for molecules in a given set of categories (circle plot, chord plot, cluster plot). The package provides a deeper insight into omics data and allows scientists to generate insightful plots with only a few lines of code to easily communicate the findings.},

However, the underlying mechanisms and location for generating such innate memory responses in vivo remain unknown. Here, we show that access of Bacillus Calmette-Gu{\'{e}}rin (BCG) to the bone marrow (BM) changes the transcriptional landscape of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and multipotent progenitors (MPPs), leading to local cell expansion and enhanced myelopoiesis at the expense of lymphopoiesis. Importantly, BCG-educated HSCs generate epigenetically modified macrophages that provide significantly better protection against virulent M. tuberculosis infection than na{\"{i}}ve macrophages. By using parabiotic and chimeric mice, as well as adoptive transfer approaches, we demonstrate that training of the monocyte/macrophage lineage via BCG-induced HSC reprogramming is sustainable in vivo.

Similarity or distance measures are core components used by distance-based clustering algorithms to cluster similar data points into the same clusters, while dissimilar or distant data points are placed into different clusters. The performance of similarity measures is mostly addressed in two or three-dimensional spaces, beyond which, to the best of our knowledge, there is no empirical study that has revealed the behavior of similarity measures when dealing with high-dimensional datasets. To fill this gap, a technical framework is proposed in this study to analyze, compare and benchmark the influence of different similarity measures on the results of distance-based clustering algorithms. For reproducibility purposes, fifteen publicly available datasets were used for this study, and consequently, future distance measures can be evaluated and compared with the results of the measures discussed in this work. These datasets were classified as low and high-dimensional categories to study the performance of each measure against each category.

	abstract = {Copyright 2018 by the American Thoracic Society. Rationale: Contacts of patients with tuberculosis (TB) constitute an important target population for preventive measures because they are at high risk of infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and progression to disease. Objectives: We investigated bio-signatures with predictive ability for incident TB. Methods: In a case-control study nested within the Grand Challenges 6-74 longitudinal HIV-negative African cohort of exposed household contacts, we employed RNA sequencing, PCR, and the pair ratio algorithm in a training/test set approach. Overall, 79 progressors who developed TB between 3 and 24 months after diagnosis of index case and 328 matched nonprogressors who remained healthy during 24 months of follow-up were investigated. Measurements and Main Results: A four-transcript signature derived from samples in a South African and Gambian training set predicted progression up to two years before onset of disease in blinded test set samples from South Africa, the Gambia, and Ethiopia with little population-associated variability, and it was also validated in an external cohort of South African adolescents with latent M. tuberculosis infection. By contrast, published diagnostic or prognostic TB signatures were predicted in samples from some but not all three countries, indicating site-specific variability. Post hoc meta-analysis identified a single gene pair, C1QC/TRAV27 (complement C1q C-chain / T-cell receptor-a variable gene 27) that would consistently predict TB progression in household contacts from multiple African sites but not in infected adolescents without known recent exposure events. Conclusions: Collectively, we developed a simple whole blood-based PCR test to predict TB in recently exposed household contacts from diverse African populations. This test has potential for implementation in national TB contact investigation programs.},

	abstract = {The PANTHER database (Protein ANalysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships, http://pantherdb.org) contains comprehensive information on the evolution and function of protein-coding genes from 104 completely sequenced genomes. PANTHER software tools allow users to classify new protein sequences, and to analyze gene lists obtained from large-scale genomics experiments. In the past year, major improvements include a large expansion of classification information available in PANTHER, as well as significant enhancements to the analysis tools. Protein subfamily functional classifications have more than doubled due to progress of the Gene Ontology Phylogenetic Annotation Project. For human genes (as well as a few other organisms), PANTHER now also supports enrichment analysis using pathway classifications from the PA resource. The gene list enrichment tools include a new ‘hierarchical view' of results, enabling users to leverage the structure of the classifications/ontologies; the tools also allow users to upload genetic variant data directly, rather than requiring prior conversion to a gene list. The updated coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) scoring tool uses an improved algorithm. The hidden Markov model (HMM) search tools now use HMMER3, dramatically reducing search times and improving accuracy of E-value statistics. Finally, the PANTHER Tree-Attribute Viewer has been implemented in JavaScript, with new views for exploring protein sequence evolution.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n},

	abstract = {Background Identification of blood biomarkers that prospectively predict progression of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection to tuberculosis disease might lead to interventions that combat the tuberculosis epidemic. We aimed to assess whether global gene expression measured in whole blood of healthy people allowed identification of prospective signatures of risk of active tuberculosis disease. Methods In this prospective cohort study, we followed up healthy, South African adolescents aged 12–18 years from the adolescent cohort study (ACS) who were infected with M tuberculosis for 2 years. We collected blood samples from study participants every 6 months and monitored the adolescents for progression to tuberculosis disease. A prospective signature of risk was derived from whole blood RNA sequencing data by comparing participants who developed active tuberculosis disease (progressors) with those who remained healthy (matched controls). After adaptation to multiplex quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), the signature was used to predict tuberculosis disease in untouched adolescent samples and in samples from independent cohorts of South African and Gambian adult progressors and controls. Participants of the independent cohorts were household contacts of adults with active pulmonary tuberculosis disease. Findings Between July 6, 2005, and April 23, 2007, we enrolled 6363 participants from the ACS study and 4466 from independent South African and Gambian cohorts. 46 progressors and 107 matched controls were identified in the ACS cohort. A 16 gene signature of risk was identified. The signature predicted tuberculosis progression with a sensitivity of 66{\textperiodcentered}1{\%} (95{\%} CI 63{\textperiodcentered}2–68{\textperiodcentered}9) and a specificity of 80{\textperiodcentered}6{\%} (79{\textperiodcentered}2–82{\textperiodcentered}0) in the 12 months preceding tuberculosis diagnosis. The risk signature was validated in an untouched group of adolescents (p=0{\textperiodcentered}018 for RNA sequencing and p=0{\textperiodcentered}0095 for qRT-PCR) and in the independent South African and Gambian cohorts (p values {\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001 by qRT-PCR) with a sensitivity of 53{\textperiodcentered}7{\%} (42{\textperiodcentered}6–64{\textperiodcentered}3) and a specificity of 82{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} (76{\textperiodcentered}7–86) in the 12 months preceding tuberculosis. Interpretation The whole blood tuberculosis risk signature prospectively identified people at risk of developing active tuberculosis, opening the possibility for targeted intervention to prevent the disease.

	abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB), caused by infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Efforts to control it are hampered by difficulties with diagnosis, prevention and treatment. Most people infected with M. tuberculosis remain asymptomatic, termed latent TB, with a 10{\%} lifetime risk of developing active TB disease. Current tests, however, cannot identify which individuals will develop disease. The immune response to M. tuberculosis is complex and incompletely characterized, hindering development of new diagnostics, therapies and vaccines. Here we identify a whole-blood 393 transcript signature for active TB in intermediate and high-burden settings, correlating with radiological extent of disease and reverting to that of healthy controls after treatment. A subset of patients with latent TB had signatures similar to those in patients with active TB. We also identify a specific 86-transcript signature that discriminates active TB from other inflammatory and infectious diseases. Modular and pathway analysis revealed that the TB signature was dominated by a neutrophil-driven interferon (IFN)-inducible gene profile, consisting of both IFN-gamma and type I IFN-alphabeta signalling. Comparison with transcriptional signatures in purified cells and flow cytometric analysis suggest that this TB signature reflects changes in cellular composition and altered gene expression. Although an IFN-inducible signature was also observed in whole blood of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), their complete modular signature differed from TB, with increased abundance of plasma cell transcripts. Our studies demonstrate a hitherto underappreciated role of type I IFN-alphabeta signalling in the pathogenesis of TB, which has implications for vaccine and therapeutic development. Our study also provides a broad range of transcriptional biomarkers with potential as diagnostic and prognostic tools to combat the TB epidemic.},

DNA methylation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from BCG vaccinated infants was measured and comparisons made between low and high BCG-specific cytokine responders. We found 318 genes and 67 pathways with distinct patterns of DNA methylation, including immune pathways, e.g. for T cell activation, that are known to directly affect immune responses. We also highlight signalling pathways that could indirectly affect the BCG-induced immune response: potassium and calcium channel, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, G Protein coupled receptor (GPCR), glutamate signalling and WNT pathways. This study suggests that in addition to immune pathways, cellular processes drive vaccine-induced immune responses.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION A proportion of tuberculosis (TB) case contacts do not become infected, even when heavily exposed. We studied the innate immune responses of TB case contacts to understand their role in protection against infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, termed 'early clearance'. METHODS Indonesian household contacts of TB cases were tested for interferon-$\gamma$ release assay (IGRA) conversion between baseline and 14 weeks post-recruitment. Blood cell populations and ex-vivo innate whole blood cytokine responses were measured at baseline and, in a subgroup, flow cytometry was performed at weeks 2 and 14. Immunological characteristics were measured for early clearers, defined as a persistently negative IGRA at 3 months, and converters, whose IGRA converted from negative to positive. RESULTS Among 1347 case contacts, 317 were early clearers and 116 converters. Flow cytometry showed a resolving innate cellular response from 2 to 14 weeks in persistently IGRA negative contacts but not converters. There were no differences in cytokine responses to mycobacterial stimuli, but compared to converters, persistently IGRA negative contacts produced more proinflammatory cytokines following heterologous stimulation with Escherichia coli and Streptococcus pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS Early clearance of M. tuberculosis is associated with enhanced heterologous innate immune responses similar to those activated during induction of trained immunity.},

Heterogeneity of the sarcoidosis signature correlated significantly with disease activity. Transcriptional profiles in pneumonia and lung cancer revealed an over-abundance of inflammatory transcripts. After successful treatment the transcriptional activity in tuberculosis and pneumonia patients was significantly reduced. However the glucocorticoid-responsive sarcoidosis patients showed a significant increase in transcriptional activity. 144-blood transcripts were able to distinguish tuberculosis from other lung diseases and controls.Conclusions:Tuberculosis and sarcoidosis revealed similar blood transcriptional profiles, dominated by interferon-inducible transcripts, while pneumonia and lung cancer showed distinct signatures, dominated by inflammatory genes.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accurate assessment of treatment efficacy would facilitate clinical trials of new antituberculosis drugs. We hypothesized that early alterations in peripheral immunity could be measured by gene expression profiling in tuberculosis patients undergoing successful conventional combination treatment. METHODS: Ex vivo blood samples from 27 pulmonary tuberculosis patients were assayed at diagnosis and during treatment. RNA was processed and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChips, to determine expression of over 47,000 transcripts. RESULTS: There were significant {\textgreater}/= 2-fold changes in expression of {\textgreater}4000 genes during treatment. Rapid, large-scale changes were detected, with down-regulated expression of 1261 genes within the first week, including inflammatory markers such as complement components C1q and C2. This was followed by slower changes in expression of different networks of genes, including a later increase in expression of B-cell markers, transcription factors, and signaling molecules. CONCLUSIONS: The fast initial down-regulation of expression of inflammatory mediators coincided with rapid killing of actively dividing bacilli, whereas slower delayed changes occurred as drugs acted on dormant bacilli and coincided with lung pathology resolution. Measurement of biosignatures during clinical trials of new drugs could be useful predictors of rapid bactericidal or sterilizing drug activity, and would expedite the licensing of new treatment regimens.},

	abstract = {In general, DNA methylation acts in concert with other epigenetic processes, including histone modifications, chromatin remodeling and microRNAs, to shape the overall chromatin structure of the nucleus and potentially modify its functional state. Aberrant DNA methylation events can occur in a number of human diseases but we are only just beginning to appreciate the scope and magnitude of this process in human health. As one example, in contrast to normal cells, the cancer methylome is characterized by reciprocal hypermethylation of specific regulatory regions of genes along with an overall decrease in the quantity of 5-methylcytosine throughout the remainder of the genome. Currently, near genome-wide technologies are available and have been utilized to examine the extent of DNA methylation in discovery-based studies involving several physiological and disease states. Although early in the process, DNA methylation is being explored as a biomarker to be used in clinical practice for early detection of disease, tumor classification and for predicting disease outcome or recurrence. This perspective focuses on the current and future states of the use of DNA methylation biomarkers in disease diagnosis, prognosis and classification, with a particular emphasis on cancer.},

	ABSTRACT={Patients with glioblastoma (GBM) have a poor outcome, but even among patients receiving the same therapies and with good prognostic factors, one can find those with exceptionally short and long survival. From the Nordic trial, which randomized GBM patients of 60 years or older between two radiotherapy arms (60 Gy or 34 Gy) or temozolomide (TMZ), we selected 59 with good prognostic factors. These selected GBM patients were equally distributed according to treatment and MGMT promoter methylation status but had long or short survival. Methylation profiling with the Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip arrays was performed and utilized for methylation-based CNS tumor classification, and pathway enrichment analysis of differentially methylated CpG sites (DMCs), as well as calculation of epigenetic age acceleration with three different algorithms, to compare the long and short survival groups. Samples identified by the classifier as non-GBM IDH wildtype were excluded. DMCs between long- and short-term survivors were found in patients with methylated MGMT promoter treated with TMZ (123,510), those with unmethylated MGMT treated with 60Gy radiotherapy (4,086), and with methylated MGMT promoter treated with 34Gy radiotherapy (39,649). Long-term survivors with methylated MGMT promoter treated with TMZ exhibited hypermethylation of the Wnt signaling and the platelet activation, signaling, and aggregation pathways. The joint analysis of radiotherapy arms revealed 319 DMCs between long- and short-term survivors with unmethylated MGMT and none for samples with methylated MGMT promoter. An analysis comparing epigenetic age acceleration between patients with long- and short-term survival across all treatment arms showed a decreased epigenetic age acceleration for the latter. We identified DMCs for both TMZ and RT-treated patients and epigenetic age acceleration as a potential prognostic marker, but further systematic analysis of larger patient cohorts is necessary for confirmation of their prognostic and/or predictive properties.}

The genomic information is stored in the GENES database, which is a collection of gene catalogs for all the completely sequenced genomes and some partial genomes with up-to-date annotation of gene functions. The higher order functional information is stored in the PATHWAY database, which contains graphical representations of cellular processes, such as metabolism, membrane transport, signal transduction and cell cycle. The PATHWAY database is supplemented by a set of ortholog group tables for the information about conserved subpathways (pathway motifs), which are often encoded by positionally coupled genes on the chromosome and which are especially useful in predicting gene functions. A third database in KEGG is LIGAND for the information about chemical compounds, enzyme molecules and enzymatic reactions. KEGG provides Java graphics tools for browsing genome maps, comparing two genome maps and manipulating expression maps, as well as computational tools for sequence comparison, graph comparison and path computation. The KEGG databases are daily updated and made freely available (http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/ ).}",

Reactome thus functions both as a digital archive of manually curated human biological processes and as a tool for discovering functional relationships in data such as gene expression profiles or somatic mutation catalogs from tumor cells. Recent curation work has expanded our annotations of normal and disease-associated signaling processes and of the drugs that target them, in particular infections caused by the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses and the host response to infection. New tools support better simultaneous analysis of high-throughput data from multiple sources and the placement of understudied (‘dark’) proteins from analyzed datasets in the context of Reactome’s manually curated pathways.}",

Increasingly more content creators, initiatives, projects and tools have started using WikiPathways. Central in this growth and increased use of WikiPathways are the various communities that focus on particular subsets of molecular pathways such as for rare diseases and lipid metabolism. Knowledge from published pathway figures helps prioritize pathway development, using optical character and named entity recognition. We show the growth of WikiPathways over the last three years, highlight the new communities and collaborations of pathway authors and curators, and describe various technologies to connect to external resources and initiatives. The road toward a sustainable, community-driven pathway database goes through integration with other resources such as Wikidata and allowing more use, curation and redistribution of WikiPathways content.}",
