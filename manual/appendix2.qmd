# Use of Docker Container {#sec-docker}

## On Windows

::: {.callout-caution}
PLEASE NOTE: Only AMD64 OS
:::

1. Please make sure you have installed latest version of Docker Desktop on your Windows machine.
2. Using 'command-prompt' or 'Powershell', run the command ```docker pull jd21/methylr:latest```.
3. Open Docker Desktop, under the tab 'images', on the LOCAL images, the docker image will be available as shown in the following figure

![Docker container: Figure 1](_images/docker_container_windows1.png)

4. Now, click on the RUN, it will open the 'Optional settings'. Under the 'Optional settings', select the 'Port (Host port)' and write **3838** and click 'RUN'. \

5. Click on the **Containers** on the side tab and then click **PORT(S)** '3838:3838'. The default web-browser will open and in a few minutes will start the app (It will take approximately 1-3 minutes to view the app).

::: {.callout-note}
**NOTE**: You can copy *http://localhost:3838* after running the container and open it on other web-browser to run the app. \

## On MacOS
::: {.callout-caution}
PLEASE NOTE: (Intel, Only AMD64 OS - not supported on Apple M1/M2 processors)
:::

1. Please make sure you have installed latest version of Docker Desktop on your MacOS.
2. Run the command,  ```docker pull jd21/methylr:latest``` on Mac *terminal*.
3. If you are using the **Docker Desktop** to use *methylR*, please follow the instructions from 3 to 5 as mentioned above for Windows.
4. Alternatively, if you want to use the MacOS *terminal* to run the app (**Only supported on Intel AMD64 OS architecture**), please use this command ```docker run --rm -p 3838:3838 jd21/methylr:latest``` directly and after pulling all the images by docker, *terminal* will display

``` 
5. Now, open the web-browser and run ```http://localhost:3838``` will load the app within 1-3 minutes.

::: {.callout-note}
PLEASE NOTE: It may possible that you run the docker container on MacOS Apple M1, but the application may not work as expected. We strongly recommend to use AMD64 OS architecture to run *methylR*
:::

## On Linux (Ubuntu 20.04LTS)
1. If you want to use the linux *terminal* to run *methylR*, use the following command on the *terminal*
```
docker run --rm -p 3838:3838 jd21/methylr:latest
```
2. If you want to use the Docker Desktop for Linux, first pull the docker container using ```docker pull jd21/methylr:latest``` from *terminal* and then follow Step 3-5 as mentioned above for Windows.

::: {.callout-note}
1. Please contact the IT support if Docker is running properly. You can also contact the developers using the [*GitHub*](https://github.com/JD2112/methylr/issues) or the [*Google groups*](https://groups.google.com/g/methylr) or directly [email the developer](mailto:methylr@googlegroups.com).
2. If after uploading the data for methylation analysis (see @sec-methylysis), the browser get disconnected, please check you have installed the docker or docker-desktop with administrative privilages. From terminal, user can run,
```
$ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
or
$ sudo chown $USER /var/run/docker.sock
```
