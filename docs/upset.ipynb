    "## How to use\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data upload\n",
    "1. *Upload*: Data can be uploaded as TEXT or CSV or Semicolon separated format. Please look into the example data file.\n",
    "    UpSet module takes three types of inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "    i. List type data:\n",
    "   List data is a correctly formatted csv/text file, with lists of names. Each column represents a set, and each row represents an element (names/gene/SNPs). Header names (first row) will be used as set names.\n",
    "    ii. Binary type data:\n",
    "    In the binary input file each column represents a set, and each row represents an element. If a names is in the set then it is represented as a 1, else it is represented as a 0.\n",
    "    iii. Combination/expression type data:\n",
    "    Combination/expression type data is the possible combinations of set intersections.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters setup\n",
    "2. *Settings*: Under settings, there are multiple options to display the plot -\n",
    "    \n",
    "    i. *select sets*: select the dataset from the input data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ii. *Number of intersections to show*: Please add the number to calculate the intersection.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    iii. *Order intersections by*: From the drop-down menu, please select the intersection order -  \n",
    "    - Frequency\n",
    "    - degree\n",
    "    iv. *Increaing/Decreasing*: Please select the order of the frequency/degree. \n",

    "    xi. *Connecting point size*: change the connecting point size .\n",
    "\n",
    "    xii. *Connecting line size*: change the connecting line size.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Font & Color*: multiple ooptions are included for font and colours -\n",
