First, all results from the analysis pipeline will be saved in the same folder from where the data loaded, and B. Second, using the on-screen visualization tool.\nIn the visualization tabs of both ChAMP and minfi pipelines in methylysis, we introduced 4 tabs for differential methylation analysis result: 1. QC result: QC result from each pipeline mentioned above will be generated and presented here in PDF format. User can download the PDF, however the result will also be saved in the data directory. For ChAMP analysis, there will be 1) Density plot of raw data, 2) 1000 most variable positions beta value distribution plot, and 3) heirarchical clustering plot. For minfi analysis, the QC PDF file will contains - 1) density plot distribution of beta values, bean density plot, 3) bisulfite conversion I, 4) bisulfite conversion II, and dotplots of 5) extension 6) hybridization, 7) specificity analysis. 2. Normalized data table: Only first 100 rows from the normalizedvalues will appear in the visualization tab. The full result will be saved on the data directory. For minfi analysis, two different options are available, beta value and M-value (methylation value).  3. Cell type deconvolution plot: If user choose to analyze the cell type deconvolution, the analysis figure will appear here. Please note, current version only supports the PBMC deconvolution. 4. DMC table: First 100 rows of the differentially methylated CpGs will appear here and the full result will be saved as mentioned above.  5. Download results: Users can download all analysis result as a zip, including QC, normalized data, cell type deconvolution data, differentially methylated annotated data. Please note, all these files will be deleted once the user close the browser."

    "text": "1.2 Parameters setup\n\n1.2.1 Choose analysis algorithm\nCurrently, we have included two most usable algorithms to analyze the data - ChAMP and minfi.\n\n\n\n\nAlgorithm choice\n\n\n\n1.2.1.1 ChAMP pipeline parameters\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE: ChAMP will do all filtration automatically, independent of User’s input. The following filtration will be done -\ni. filtering probes with detection p-value > 0.01,\nii. filter out probes with <3 beads in at least 5% of samples per probe,\niii. filter all non-CpG probes\niv. filter all SNP-related probes\nv. filter all multi-hit probes\nvi. filter all probes located in X and Y chromosomes\n\n\n\nChoose type of Illumina array: Two options are provided to choose, namely EPIC/850K array and 450K array from Illumina array analysis.\nAdjusted P-value: User can define there own adjusted P-value to run the analysis. The default is 0.05.\nNormalization: User can choose different normalization methods from the drop-down list,\n\nBMIQ (Beta-Mixture Quantile Normalization) (Teschendorff et al. 2013),\nPBC (Peak-Based Correction) (Dedeurwaerder et al. 2011),\n\n\nThe default setup will run with the BMIQ normalization method. Please check references for different type of normalization method\n\nBatch Effect Correction: ComBat function is used to correct the batch effect. User can choose whether to compute the batch effect or not by clicking the button. When the button is (ON), it will prompt to select the factors for the batch effect correction, Slide, Array, Age, Sex, or Other. Select as necessary and should have the column in the Sample_sheet. If you have other option than Slide, Array, Age or Sex, rename the column as ‘Other’ and run batch effect correction. If the button is (OFF), the pipeline will continue without analyzing the batch effect. Please check the reference for the batch effect correction using combat method (Johnson, Li, and Rabinovic 2007).\nCell Type Heterogeneity: Houseman et al (2013) (Houseman et al. 2012) algorithm is applied to calculate the cell-type heterogeneity from PBMC dataset using the refbase function. This is deactivated as default. Press the button to activate and run during the analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nChAMP parameters setup\n\n\n\n\n1.2.1.2 Minfi pipeline parameters\n\nChoose preprocess method : There are several methods available for preprocessing or normalizing the raw data using the RGset. Here we listed them as the user’s input options to select the preprocess/normalization method as per their choice:\n\nRaw: No processing of the raw data,\nSWAN: Subset Quantile Within array Normalization (Maksimovic, Gordon, and Oshlack 2012; Touleimat and Tost 2012),\nNoob: Noob preprocessing (Triche Jr et al. 2013),\nIllumina: Illumina preprocessing, as performed by Genome Studio (reverse engineered by minfi authors) (Aryee et al. 2014)\nFunnorm: Functional normalization (Fortin et al. 2014)\n\nSelect filtration method: In this section, we assigned options for the user to perform the different filters, like removal of XY chromosomes from the analysis, removal of SNPs or removal of non-specific probes from the dataset. By default, the pipeline will use p-value detection 0.01.\nCompute cell type heterogeneity: similar as ChAMP, we used Houseman method to correct the cell type heterogeneity. In minfi pipeline we used default minfi function estimateCellCounts. As before, user can choose to avoid this if the samples are not from PBMC cell types.\nPlease select the compare groups: In this option, the pipeline will ask the user to type the group names which will be compared for the differential methylation analysis. To compute the ContrastsMatrix, these group names will be used. Please use the same groups as provide in the Sample_sheet.csv.\nChoose genome annotation database: To annotate the DMC list from the analysis, use the human genome reference annotation data file. For 850K array, make sure to use the hg38 array to compare the result with the output of ChAMP pipeline.\n\n\n\n\n\nMinfi parameters setup"

User can choose to setup the number of cores depending the availability. The default is set to 1 core and maximum is 4 cores.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMultithreading for DNA methylation analysis is mainly used in the Normalization process. If you have data with more than 50 samples, using 4 cores may reduce the calculation time. If the dataset has less number of samples, increasing the number of cores will not do effectively any better time reduction.\n\n\n\nData upload The user should set the parameters first and choose all parameters as described above and then upload the data directory. To do that, just click on the button “Browse…” and locate the zip archive containing raw files. As soon as the pipeline finishes the upload of the data directory, it will start running the analysis."

    "text": "4.1 How to use\n\n4.1.1 Upload\nUser can upload the input data matrix in CSV, text or semicolon-separated format. If you don’t have the matrix, this modules provides the functionality to make it starting from the main results coming from methylysis section (Section 4.1.4). Either ChAMP and minfi will provide the input data or you can get test data by clicking on “Matrix example data” and “List example data” buttons. For a better view of the result, we added the functionality to change the number of variables on the heatmap.\n\n\n4.1.2 Settings\n\nPlot type - User can choose the heatmap or correlation plot function for the analysis.\nCorrelation Coefficient - four different types of correlation coefficient added in the module, 1) Pearson, 2) Spearman, 3) Kendall and 4) no-correlation (better for heatmap). Default chosen ‘non’ (no-correlation).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE: IF YOU WANT TO PERFORM THE CORRELATION PLOT, THEN PLEASE SELECT PEARSON, SPEARMAN OR KENDALL.\n\n\n\nAgglomeration method for hclust - different agglomeration method for hierarchical cluster analysis provided in the module, 1) war.D, 2) ward.D2, 3) single, 4) Complete, 5) Average, 6) Mcquitty, 7) Median, and 8) Centroid. Default chosen ‘Complete’.\nNo. of clusters for hclust - user can set the number of hierarchical cluster for their data. Default is 3.\nDistance Matrix computation - different types of distance matrix calculation can be applied to generate the heatmap, 1) Euclidean, 2) Manhattan, 3) Canberra, 4) Minkowski or 5) none. Default is ‘Euclidean’.\nDendrogram - user can choose to show the dendrogram on the row and/or column list.\nColor key - selecting color key will give option to change the size of the color key. However, user can choose not to show the color-key. Also color key title is user-defined.\naxis label - both x and y-axis label is user-defined. User can change the label of the x and y axis.\nTitle - It will change the title of the heatmap/ correlation plot.\nZoom in & out Heatmap - for the static plot, user can set the zoom in/out option.\n\n\n\n4.1.3 Font & Color\n\nSelect theme - with the pre-defined theme colors, custom-defined color for the heatmap is also enabled.\nlabel - user can separately define the size, rotation and color of the label text.\nColor - rectangle border, grid color and label color is also user-defined.\n\n\n\n4.1.4 Matrix preparation\nWe added a tab for the user to build the heatmap matrix by starting from the results of the main analysis, regardless the user choice to perform it with ChAMP or minfi. The matrix can be uploaded directly on the Upload tab to run the heatmap analysis.\n1. Upload normalized data table - user can upload the normalized table from the main analysis directly without any modification.\n2. Upload DMC data table - user can upload the differentially methylated CpG data table from the main analysis directly without any modification.\n3. Select adjusted P-value - for more filtration on the dataset, we set a adjusted p-value (BH-corrected as defined in the main analysis section, both ChAMP or minfi) parameter. Default is 0.05.\n4. Select logFC value - for more filtration on the dataset, we set a logFC (as defined in the main analysis section, both ChAMP or minfi) parameter. Default is 0.1."
