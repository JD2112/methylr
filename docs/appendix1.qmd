# Create the input zip file for *methylR* {#sec-inputzip}

This section describes how to create a zip archive containing the input files to start the methylysis analysis.

## Methods
We will describe three methods to create a zip file:

1. Windows zip utility
2. 7-zip ([https://www.7-zip.org/](https://www.7-zip.org/))
3. Bash script ([https://www.github.com/](https://github.com/JD2112/methylr/blob/main/script.sh))
4. Command line (Ubuntu Linux)

### Description
Users need to collect the Sample_sheet.csv file and all the idat files belonging to the analysis as they come from the sequencer. All the methods require to create a New folder (you can give any name, for example **testData**) and move the *Sample_sheet.csv* file inside. Enter the testData directory and then create a folder named **idat**, then move all the directories generated with the analysis and containing the *idat files* (green and red) into this idat folder. In the end you will get this kind of organisation:

## 3. Bash script (MacOS/Linux)
We provide an automathized bash script that is able to create the file structure discussed above for you.

### Linux:
Depending on which interface you use (e.g., GNOME, KDE, Xfce), the terminal will be accessed differently. We recommend you check [Ubuntu's Using the Terminal](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal?action=show&redirect=BasicCommands) page for the several ways to access the terminal.

1. Click Start and search for "Terminal". Alternatively, press *Alt + Ctrl + t* and type "cmd" then click OK.
2. Then type the following command:
```
cd /path/to/data/
sh script.sh
```

### MacOS:
1. You can access the terminal by pressing âŒ˜ + space on your keyboard and searching for "terminal".
2. Then type the following command and press Enter:
```
cd /path/to/data/
sh script.sh
```

## 4. Command line (Linux)
Depending on which interface you use (e.g. GNOME, KDE, Xfce), the terminal will be accessed differently. We recommend you check [Ubuntu's Using the Terminal](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal?action=show&redirect=BasicCommands) page for the several ways to access the terminal.

1. Click Start and search for "Terminal". Alternatively, press *Alt + Ctrl + t* and type "cmd" then click OK.
