    "### Data upload\n",
    "1. *Upload*: Data can be uploaded as TEXT or CSV or Semicolon separated format. Please look into the example data file.\n",
    "    UpSet module takes three types of inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. List type data:\n",
    "   List data is a correctly formatted csv/text file, with lists of names. Each column represents a set, and each row represents an element (names/gene/SNPs). Header names (first row) will be used as set names.\n",
    "    2. Binary type data:\n",
    "    In the binary input file each column represents a set, and each row represents an element. If a names is in the set then it is represented as a 1, else it is represented as a 0.\n",
    "    3. Combination/expression type data:\n",
    "    Combination/expression type data is the possible combinations of set intersections. For example;\n",
